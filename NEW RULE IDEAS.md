- FKS: check for nocheck, not for replication
- Constraints: check for udf usage, nocheck
- @@IDENTITY check
- Suggest SCHEMABINDING for functions that do not touch tables
- Detect sql injection possibilities??? 
  - Would like to only detect injection opportunies where sql is being concatenated in from a variable. 
  - Would also like to build a scanner for .Net code
